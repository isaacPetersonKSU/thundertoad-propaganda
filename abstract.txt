#Abstract
Mushroom cultivation is growing, both as a hobby and a small business
opportunity. Grain spawn is a nutrient-dense food source fully colonized and
free from contamination. It is used to inoculate a larger substrate, like straw
or sawdust, giving the desired fungus a head start against any competing
decomposers. Because producing it can be slow and tedious, it is often
expensive. I designed a device that makes grain spawn production easier and
quicker. The project runs on a raspberry pi zero SBC. The sensor and control
code is written in rust. Data is logged in a SQLite database. Freecad was used
to model all mechanical parts, and python was used to automate part of that
process. Data will accessable by exporting a csv of log files.
