This repo contains class presentations  related to
[thundertoad](https://github.com/ksu-cs-projects-2022-2023/spring2023-isaacPetersonKSU),
a climate-control and data-logging system for small-scale mushroom growing. This
project is currently part of a school assignment, so powerpoint presentations
are a nessicary evil, but they will be removed from the project when the
semester ends. Using a submodule gives me a clean and easy way to cleanly
remove this from the project when it is no longer needed.
