#Abstract
Mushroom cultivation is growing, both as a hobby and a small business. Grain
spawn is a nutrient-dense food source fully colonized and free from
contamination. It is used to inoculate a larger substrate, like straw or
sawdust, giving the desired fungus a head start against any competing
decomposers. Because producing it can be slow and tedious, it is often
expensive. I designed a device that seeks to make the production of grain spawn
easier and quicker.

Fresh air is filtered and pushed through to increase the
respiration rate, by making more oxygen available to the fungus. More
importantly, the respiration rate can be estimated by recording how often a the
fans must turn on to maintain a desired (and yet to be determined) O2 level. The
respiration rate of a fungal network is proportional to the amount of food it is
consuming. This is useful because sometimes you can't see if the middle
whether the container is colonized or not.

Knowing when mycelium is done eating by waiting for it to stop breathing is
not this device's only use. The food a mycelium can consume is proportional to
it's surface area, so we would expect the respiration rate to start slow, but
increase proportionally to the surface area of a sphere. Major deviations from
This model before the colony reaches the edge of the container could be a useful
way to detect contamination early because they suggest multiple inoculation
points.

The project runs on a raspberry pi zero SBC. The sensor and control code is
written in rust. Data is logged in a SQLite database. Freecad was used to model
all mechanical parts, and python was used to automate part of that process.
